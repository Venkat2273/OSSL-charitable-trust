													<b>Om Shri Charitable trust</b> is 
													a registered, independent, 
													100 % volunteer based 
													charity organization in 
													India. It is headed by <b>
													Swamy Prakash G</b>. It is now 
													being helped by local 
													volunteers as well. Though 
													the concept of reaching out 
													to the weaker and needy 
													sections of his surrounding 
													area was noble cause, to 
													implement the same with a 
													vision and mission was not 
													an easy task. Thus, there 
													was a collective effort and 
													initiative by family and 
													sons, and also with help of 
													like minded citizens and 
													well wishers, a corpus fund 
													was created through their 
													donations and to set up an 
													institution to provide 
													health and education 
													services.</font><p align="justify">
													<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">
													The aim of the Trust is to 
													develop Educational 
													Programs, establish Nursing 
													Homes / Hospitals and Temples 
													etc. So that we can provide 
													better opportunities for 
													underprivileged children and 
													people to make their 
													experience of this world a 
													joyous one.<br>

&nbsp; •<b> Improving their formal education<br>
&nbsp; • Improving their physical well-being<br>
&nbsp; • Nurturing their natural creative abilities<br>
&nbsp; • Providing vocational training<br>
&nbsp; • To establish nursing Home/Hospital<br>
&nbsp; • Raising awareness for different issues and struggles in daily life<br>
													</b>
													<br>
													It is a grass roots 
													organization which aims to 
													provide the most 
													disadvantaged children with 
													education, supplemental 
													nutrition and medical 
													assistance. In doing so we 
													strive to improve the 
													quality of life for those 
													highly vulnerable children.
													<br>
													<br>
													Our aim is not only to look 
													after the physical well 
													being and education of the 
													kids but also their 
													consciousness.
													We want to raise their 
													awareness so that they can 
													not only heal themselves but 
													also their families and 
													society and be pillars of 
													awareness for our world.</font><p align="justify">

													At last let us solemnly 
													declare that the scope of 
													our vision and mission is 
													not limited to the areas 
													described above, but it is a 
													continuous process changing 
													according to the needs and 
													tastes of the time and we 
													are committed to discharge 
													our obligation and 
													responsibilities towards the 
													society by enabling the 
													citizens to stand up on 
													their own feet , sow the 
													seeds of their choice, 
													nature it with care and 
													finally harvest the same and 
													enjoy its fruits 
													collectively in the long
